# Time-Series-Data-in-Python

## Description :
In this repository, I have explained basics of manipulating time series data. 
- How to use pandas built-in methods to work with time series index.
- How to resample time series data.
- How to calculate rolling and cummulative values for time series data.

This repository is further divided into 4 sub-chapters.
- **Chapter-1 : Working with Time Series in pandas**
- **Chapter-2 : Time Series Metrics and Resampling**
- **Chapter-3 : Resampling and Interpolation**
- **Chapter-4 : Window Functions with pandas**

## 1. [CHAPTER-1](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Time-Series-Data-in-Python/tree/main/Chapter-1)
In this chapter, I have explained how to create, manipulate and do calculations on time series data.

## 2. [CHAPTER-2](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Time-Series-Data-in-Python/tree/main/Chapter-2)
In this chapter, I have explained how to compare different time series,also, what is resampling and its types.

## 3. [CHAPTER-3](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Time-Series-Data-in-Python/tree/main/Chapter-3)
In this chapter, I have explained how to resample and interpolate time series data using pandas in Python.

How to do upsampling and use different interpolation techniques.

And, how to do downsampling and grouping the data.

## 4. [CHAPTER-4](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Time-Series-Data-in-Python/tree/main/Chapter-4)
In this chapter, I have explained what are Window functions? Also, how to calculate time series metrics for both types of window functions - Rolling and Expanding functions.
