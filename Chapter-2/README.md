# Time Series Metrics and Resampling

In this jupyter notebook, I have explained how to compare different time series, what is resampling and its types.

### Part-1 ==> Comparing different time series
* Normalizing single series
* Normalizing multiple series
* Comparing time series with a benchmark

### Part-2 ==> Changing time series frequency: Resampling
* Method 1
* Method 2

### Part-3 ==> Upsampling and Interpolation with .resample()
* .resample() function
* Interpolation

### Part-4 ==> Downsampling and Aggregation methods
