# Time Series Metrics and Resampling

In this jupyter notebook, I have explained how to compare different time series, what is resampling and its types.

### Part-1 ==> Comparing different time series
* Normalizing single series
* Normalizing multiple series
* Comparing time series with a benchmark
* Datasets used :
    * Google Stock Prices Data
    * Asset Classes Data
    * Microsoft-Apple Stock Prices Data

### Part-2 ==> Changing time series frequency: Resampling
* Method 1
* Method 2
* Datasets used :
    * US Unemployment Data

### Part-3 ==> Upsampling and Interpolation with .resample()
* .resample() function
* Interpolation
* Datasets used :
    * US Unemployment Data
    * Debt Unemployment Data
    * GDP Growth Rate Data

### Part-4 ==> Downsampling and Aggregation methods
* Datasets used :
    * Ozone Data - New York City (NYC)
